// sit under it as secondary picks. KolmoPDF stays first on purpose.

		longBlurb:
			"Most of what I automate starts by getting clean text out of a PDF, and ordinary parsers fall apart the moment a page has two columns, a formula, or a table that runs across the page break. KolmoPDF is the one I reach for: VLM-based parsing that keeps formulas, tables, code blocks, and multi-column order intact, layout-preserving translation when the source isn't in English, and an API clean enough to wire straight into an agent or a knowledge base. It runs the other direction too - Markdown back out to DOCX, HTML, LaTeX, or PDF.",

		longBlurb:
			"When the bottleneck is the keyboard, not the idea, I switch to Typeless. Speak naturally and it drops polished text into whatever app is focused — messages, notes, editors — with filler words gone and punctuation already in place. Not a full writing stack, just a faster way to get the first draft out of my head.",
